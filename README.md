# A blockchain, Zhylic, purely fictive
_For some history for our dear readers, This cryptocurrency is merely a feverdream by one person somewhere, created after a minor kerfuffle with Ethereum._
_In all truth, as of january of the year 2025, this is not meant to be taken as a serious endeavour, on anyone's part._
_Merely seeing this project is proof of God, otherwise it would have been relegated to the dustbin of history._
_If in all truth, you would be inticed to work on this cursed pile of trash, I would suggest you to email "zhylic.vasiliy@protonmail.com" a message containing your github account. I will also give you 2000 free tokens if you do join. I have 0 demands other than some knowledge of Zig and one commit that is not updating this file._
